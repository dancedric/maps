# Maps

### Introduction
Maps is a small web app that lets users plot places they've travelled to (or places they would want to travel to).
At the time of writing, when the user is done the user can take a screenshot so that they can save and set it as their desktop background.

### Tech
jQuery, Google Maps javascript API

### Assistance
At the time of writing, this "Single-Page Application" is basically a Minimum Viable Product. This website has no goal or objective. This, at least right now, is purely out of coding and travel passion. 
Please refer to the "Issues" and treat it as the "todo list".
